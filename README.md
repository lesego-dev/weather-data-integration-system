# Weather Data Integration System

## Overview

This project demonstrates a backend system for retrieving and processing weather data from external APIs.

It showcases data ingestion, processing, and integration — key components of modern data engineering and machine learning systems.

## Features

- External weather API integration
- Async data retrieval
- Modular architecture
- Data processing and handling

## Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture:

- API Layer – Handles external API calls
- Service Layer – Processes and transforms data
- Model Layer – Represents structured data

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- REST APIs
- Async Programming

## Relevance to Data Engineering and ML

This project demonstrates:

- Data ingestion pipelines
- External data integration
- Backend system architecture
- Foundations for ML data pipelines

## Future Improvements

- Store data in BigQuery
- Build REST API endpoint
- Deploy to cloud
